## Project Motivation:
The main motivation of this project is to analyse the [Friends Episode Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/bcruise/friends-episode-data) which contains 
the episode wise IMDB rating and US viewership data of the American sitcom TV Show - 'Friends'.Through this project I strive to find out what are the factors that highly contributed to the show's huge success. We'll explore the following questions in this project.
1) Which season is considered to be the best liked?

2) Which character was given the most importance in the show?

3) Which character has the highest rating and viewership per episode?

4) Which director captured a wider fan base?

5) Which writer contributed more to fan favourite episodes?
